1. Create directorynamed invoice1
2. Craete table
3. Declare all variables, sort by product
4. Declare Exprice var; set Quant*Price = Extend Price
- Declare SubTotal = sum total exprice
- Set tax variable = 5.75% Subtotal; dislpay tax amount
- declare Var.Grand total = tax + sub total

- use sals table tempplate; isplay the item, quantity, price, extended price.

-Option 2: Add an id="invoiceTable" to the table. Remove the product row template. In its place use

    // item row 1
   var row = invoiceTable.insertRow();
   row.insertCell().innerHTML = item1; 
   row.insertCell().innerHTML = quantity1;
   row.insertCell().innerHTML = price1.toFixed(2);
   row.insertCell().innerHTML = extended_price1;

In the Sub-total row, set this cell id="subtotal_cell" and then set .innerHTML to the subtotal value. Donâ€™t forget to add a $ sign.

In the tax row, do the same as above. Use .toFixed(2) to format the tax to 2 decimals.

In the Total row, do the same as above and use .toFixed(2) to format the grand total to 2 decimals. Display your grand total in bold print.



HINT:
Do not try to create the HTML table first. Start by simply printing each row in the table as an individual line. When you have everything calculating and printing correctly, add in the table tags.  (You could even try viewing the HTML for *this* page and copy the HTML table in the example above and then use it to change what you print in your print statement.)

HINT:
Use string templates to `document.write()` entire rows of the table rather than mixing in many little `document.write()` scripts
HINT:
Check the output as you work rather than waiting until the end. It will be faster and easier to fix problems as they occur!

Quality Checklist:

Is your code commented?	 
Minimum five products?	 
Prices not hard coded?	 
Subtotal is calculated correctly?	 
Sales tax is calculated correctly?	 
Total is calculated correctly?	 
Amounts only have 2 decimal places?	 
HTML table display?

Modification for Sal's class:

Create a directory named Invoice1.

In the Invoice1 directory, create two files: invoice.html and invoice.js.

In the invoice.html file, you can include the HTML structure for the invoice table. Here's a simplified example of the HTML structure for the invoice table:
<!-- invoice.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Sales Receipt</title>
</head>
<body>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Item</th>
                <th>Quantity</th>
                <th>Price</th>
                <th>Extended Price</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody id="invoiceTable">
            <!-- Product rows will be added dynamically using JavaScript -->
        </tbody>
        <tfoot>
            <tr>
                <td colspan="3">Sub-total</td>
                <td id="subtotal_cell">$0.00</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td colspan="3">Tax @ 5.75%</td>
                <td id="tax_cell">$0.00</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td colspan="3"><strong>Total</strong></td>
                <td id="total_cell"><strong>$0.00</strong></td>
            </tr>
        </tfoot>
    </table>
    <script src="invoice.js"></script>
</body>
</html>

In the invoice.js file, you can add the JavaScript code to calculate and display the invoice data dynamically.
